        working with indesign

    <p>
        I loved learning more about InDesign and how to properly set up an InDesign document. I have had some experience with InDesign before, but it was almost completely self-taught. I used it mostly for single page layouts or would duplicate a template document to get a similar layout in anotehr page. I had no idea about how to make use some of the most valuable features in this program such as master pages and character or paragraph styles.
