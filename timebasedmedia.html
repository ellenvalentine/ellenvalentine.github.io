    <p>
        Out of the projects so far, making this animation was the most difficult for me. I felt like I was never really able to create the effects or movement that I wanted to. My favorite part of my finished product for this one are the Illustrator drawings that I made for the characters and interactive objects (specifically the toast and the toaster). One of the parts I had the most difficulty with was making the motion paths match up. I wanted some of the movement to be on an arch, so I used the bezier handles to create the arched motion path. I found it extremely difficult to have any other object have the exact same motion path. I would try to make it match up, but because the beginning movements were different, it made the speed of the arch different. I am still proud of what I made for this project even if I am not 100% happy with it.
