        I enjoyed making this project in Illustrator, but I think my perfectionist mindset got in my way a little too much. I had the idea of making this flower alien and I couldn’t get out of my head what I really wanted it to look like. I am proud of what I created even if it is not exact to my original vision. My favorite part of this piece is the leaf collar and the leaf arms. After creating this, I am much more confident with the pen tool than I ever thought I could be. To create this piece, I also had to pay a lot of attention to layer management to make sure that I got the petals on the flower’s head correct. I made the spaceship in the background as a second thought, but it ended up being one of my favorite parts of this project! I loved figuring out how to pull each of the colors in and make it look like it really was going further into space.
